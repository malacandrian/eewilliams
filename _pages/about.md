**Why does theology have to be complicated?**

At EE Williams we believe even the little ones can see the beauty of Jesus in every passage of the Bible. We want to help invest in cultivating a new generation of leaders. Leaders who love the Lord, his word and want to tell the world who Jesus is and what he has done.

We know that for parents and leaders of childrenâ€™s, youth and student groups time is precious. We hope that these resources can help with the area of ministry you struggle with most.

Will you stand with us to build the theological foundations of our future?

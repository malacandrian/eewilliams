  //  The aim is that the rendered line height is a multiple of the minimum division of one line
  //   e.g:
  //   For a base font size of 16, and  line height of 1.5 with 2 divisions
  //      - The base line height is 24
  //      - All line heights must be a multiple of 12
  //
  //  The ceiling rule is used to make sure that the function acts in discrete steps,
  //  and will not move until the font size exceeds the basic height of the line
  //  The steps are reduced to a fraction of a line by multiplying scale by lineDivisions wherever it appears
  //  Scale is divided out at the end so the resultant line height is relative to the scaled font, rather than the base font-scale
  line-height: ($lineHeight * ceil($scale * $lineDivisions / $lineHeight))/($scale * $lineDivisions);
